# Hello-Microverse
## Description

> In this project, we were required to set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was required for this exercise. The goal here was to master all of the tools and best practices we had learned about in previous steps.
## The Learning Objectives

- Create branches with different base branches.
- Understand the concept of version control.
- Follow GitHub flow.
- Open pull requests in GitHub.
- Write descriptive, easy to understand commit messages.
- Write short, detailed, easy to understand descriptions of pull requests.
- Write a descriptive and easy to understand README in business English for every project submitted.
- Demonstrate an ability to submit a project for code review.


### The General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct ([GitHub flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md)).
- Make sure that you documented your work.

### The Requirements

- Remember to document your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).
- Create a new GitHub repo.
- Create a new branch according to the [GitHub flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md) rules.
- Add a `.gitignore` file.
- Set up [a linter for HTML and CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config) and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
- Add descriptive README file to your project - please use [this template](https://github.com/microverseinc/readme-template) but remember to customize it to your project.
- Add 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
    - A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use `h1` tag for that.
    - A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
    - A test.md file with the text "This file should be ignored by git".
- Make sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in your GitHub repository.
- Open a pull request.
